                    <p>I have a strong passion for Web Development and I am studying tirelessly to get my foot in the
                        door
                        within the industry, where I know I will flourish and become an indispensable developer for any

                        my knowledge outside of this. I am extremely dedicated and hardworking and this is reflected in

                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <h5>How I got to where I am today.</h5>
                    <p>I previously studied Programming and Software Development at TAFE and then made the transition
                        to becoming a Production Operator
                        at GMH for 7 years until the closure of the company. It gave me the opportunity to make the
                        change back to doing what I really love, which is Web Development. I’ve recently returned
                        from spending 8 months abroad living and traveling throughout South Korea with my partner. It
                        was
                        such a culturally amazing experience of a lifetime and something I thoroughly enjoyed. Now,
                        upon returning to Australia I’m taking the time to hone my skills in the fine art of Web
                        Development. I’ve completed multiple Udemy and freeCodeCamp courses to add to my previously
                        acquired knowledge from TAFE. I’m currently looking to begin my career as a Front-End developer
                        and build my skills
                        enough to become a Full-Stack developer. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="job job-3">
                    <h3>My Plan</h3>
                    <h5>My development future.</h5>
                    <p>
                        Currently studying 40-50 hours a week from home towards an initial goal of landing a Front-End
                        developer position. Once I achieve this goal I will continue to study outside of work to really
                        cement my skills to become a very well-rounded Full-Stack developer. I will strive to be the
                        best developer I can be and will always be eager to learn new things. One day I hope to be in a
                        senior role with a wealth of knowledge and experience helping new developers achieve their
                        goals.
